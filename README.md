# ASCII - POKEBALL

To use this project, I recommend always using an image with the same height and width values, then resizing it to 100x50, since characters do not occupy the same amount of space horizontally and vertically.

The image can be changed by modifying the parameter inside the ```preload()``` function, which can be found in sketch.js.
